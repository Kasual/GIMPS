Version 29.4 build 7 - See the latest WhatsNew.txt file for a full list of changes.

Highlights of version 29.4 include
    GIMPS has a new sub-project -- finding (probable) prime Mersenne cofactors.
    Like LL tests, PRP tests now support shift counts to aid in running double-checks.
    PRP tests now support a type of low overhead error checking that almost guarantees correct results even on flaky hardware.
    Because PRP tests are highly reliable, we now offer the option to do PRP tests instead of Lucas-Lehmer primality tests.
    For non-base-2 PRP tests, there is a new option to run each iteration twice and rollback if a mismatch occurs.



Software Source Code
If you use GIMPS source code to find Mersenne primes, you must agree to adhere to the GIMPS free software license agreement. Other than that restriction, you may use this code as you see fit.

The source code for the program is highly optimized Intel assembly language. There are many more-readable FFT algorithms available on the web and in textbooks. The program is also completely non-portable. If you are curious anyway, you can

The GIMPS program is very loosely based on C code written by Richard Crandall. Luke Welsh has started a web page that points to Richard Crandall's program and other available source code that you can use to help search for Mersenne primes.
