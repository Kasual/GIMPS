The libyeafft.a routines:

Guillermo Ballester Valor, gbv@oxixares.com
Klaus Kastents, kiste@bawue.de (*)

(*) From v2.8b. 24/jul/2001 

There are code in the other Glucas routines collecting ideas from a lot 
of authors. These routines cannot be considered as Guillemo and Klaus's, 
but almost all code is from their own hands.

There are also GNU utilities in the package, licensed with GPL and 
copyright of FSF.
