All the information has been moved to texinfo files.

You have complete information in 'glucas.info*' files. It is
genereated from master '*.texi' files with GNU 'makeinfo'
utility. The info files will be installed in your system info.
You even can generate a directory with html version of the
documentation files with `makeinfo --html glucas.texi`

You can visit the lastest version of html docs here:

http://glucas.sourceforge.net/glucas/index.html

A 'dvi' version of the documentation is in 'glucas.dvi' released 
with the package. You also can download it

http://glucas.sourceforge.net/docs/glucas.dvi.gz

The COPYING file conditions are *ONLY* for source in the
package where the License is inserted at the top of files.
